# calendar
CS 458 - Software Maintainability | Calendar Project

To run:
=======
1) An instance of MongoDB needs to be installed on your computer (with a valid ~data/db folder), with mongod running on port 27017

2) Run the command "activator run" from your clone of this repository. 

3) Our calendar app should be accessible on port 9000

-> Note that we have noticed that Play activator sometimes has issues if there are spaces in the file system path leading up to the cloned directory and/or if activator has not been added to your path
